**Project: Personal Finance Tracker**

**Description:**
Create a command-line program that allows users to track their income, expenses, and overall financial status.

**Requirements:**
1. **Income and Expense Tracking:** Users should be able to input their income and expenses, along with categories (e.g., salary, rent, groceries).
2. **Balance Calculation:** The program should keep track of the user's balance based on their income and expenses.
3. **Monthly Report:** Users should be able to view a summary of their monthly finances, including total income, total expenses, and balance.
4. **Data Persistence:** Implement a way to save and load the user's financial data, so it's available across different sessions.

**Bonus Features (Optional):**
1. **Category Summaries:** Provide category-wise summaries to give users insights into their spending habits.
2. **Budgeting:** Allow users to set monthly budgets for different categories and receive notifications if they exceed them.
3. **Graphical Representation:** Use a library like Matplotlib to visualize the user's financial data (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs).

**Tips:**
- Start by designing the structure of your program, including the data structures you'll use to store income, expenses, and categories.
- Consider using a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) to store the user's financial data between sessions.
- Break the program into functions to handle different tasks (e.g., adding income, adding expenses, generating reports).
- Focus on error handling to ensure that the program can handle invalid inputs or unexpected situations gracefully.

This project will help you practice data manipulation, file handling, and basic command-line user interfaces. It also has the potential for more advanced features like data visualization and budgeting, making it a versatile project for honing your Python skills.
